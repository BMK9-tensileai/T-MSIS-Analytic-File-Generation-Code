# CMS T-MSIS Analytic File (TAF) Generation Code â€“ Technical Documentation

The programs in this repository can be organized according to the file type being used to generate TAF. Most of the programs support the creation of only one type of TAF data set. The exceptions are the following programs, which contain macro functions that are shared across more than one TAF file type.

* AWS_Shared_Macros.sas
* AWS_Grouper_Macro.sas

All other programs are specific to only one TAF file type.

## Beneficiary Summary File (BSF)

The program 001_batch_bsf.sas is a driver program that calls each of the other programs in BSF creation in sequence. This is the only program that is run to create the BSF; all other programs listed below are called by this program and do not need to be run separately.

The program 000_bsf_macros.sas contains the SAS macro functions that are used throughout the rest of the BSF creation. 

The next group of programs are organized according to the T-MSIS table segments that provide the source data. Each program in the following list reads in source data from a single table segment and prepares an extract of that segment. The program names reflect the table segment as defined in the T-MSIS schema. 

* 002_bsf_ELG00002.sas
* 003_bsf_ELG00003.sas
* 004_bsf_ELG00004.sas
* 005_bsf_ELG00005.sas
* 006_bsf_ELG00006.sas
* 007_bsf_ELG00007.sas
* 008_bsf_ELG00008.sas
* 009_bsf_ELG00009.sas
* 010_bsf_ELG00010.sas
* 011_bsf_ELG00011.sas
* 012_bsf_ELG00012.sas
* 013_bsf_ELG00013.sas
* 014_bsf_ELG00014.sas
* 015_bsf_ELG00015.sas
* 016_bsf_ELG00016.sas
* 017_bsf_ELG00017.sas
* 018_bsf_ELG00018.sas
* 020_bsf_ELG00020.sas
* 021_bsf_ELG00021.sas
* 022_bsf_TPL00002.sas
* 022b_bsf_ELG00022.sas

The final program, 023_bsf_final.sas, joins the extracts together to create the BSF output.
